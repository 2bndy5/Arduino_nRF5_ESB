# Arduino_nRF5_ESB

Radio driver for the nRF5xxx chips that exposes the Nordic Semiconductors proprietary EnhancedShockburst protocol (as also used by the nRF24L01).

This library is dependent on files found in the [Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino core](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino). While it should be possible to use this library on other nRF5xxxx chips, this has only been tested on nRF52840 chips.
